Street Sense 

The Aim was to create a voting app where we collect data on unsafe 'abandoned houses' around the world. the data would have come from autheticated sources. people(who vote) whose gps is within their local area carry more weight than a person whose gps is overseas, so that the 
data being entered is less immune to bot votes.
